# Stowdo Deploy

Provides some Python scripts and a docker-compose file to deploy, scale and update Stowdo services.

## Requirements

This project requires at least [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

For Debian users, you can run the following commands to install Pipenv and Python 3.8 and Docker Compose:

```bash
$ apt install python3.8 pipenv docker-ce
$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

> For older Debian versions or Ubuntu based distributions, `docker-ce` exists under the name `docker.io` or `docker`.

> Scripts found in `scripts` folder are made to work on GNU/Linux distributions. **They may not work on other operating systems**.

## Installation

First clone this repo:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Stowdo/deploy.git
$ cd deploy
```

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
$ pipenv install
```

## Before running scripts

First navigate to the project root directory:

```bash
$ cd path/to/stowdo/deploy
```

Enter the virtual environment created by Pipenv:

```
$ pipenv shell
```

You can now use scripts provided!

## Usage

First setup the environment variables and create required folders:

```bash
$ ./scripts/setup.py
```

Then start all the containers:

```bash
$ ./scripts/start.py
```

You can scale (down or up) a service:

```bash
$ ./scripts/scale.py SERVICE SCALE
```

You can also update a service while running. The old containers will be shut down and destroyed after restarting the new ones. Load balancing will automatically redirect request to new containers without interruption.

```bash
$ ./scripts/update.py [OPTIONS]Â SERVICE VERSION
```

Finally you can shutdown Stowdo containers:

```bash
$ ./scripts/stop.py
```
